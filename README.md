# 🌍 Global Seismic Trends: Data-Driven Earthquake Insights

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes global earthquake data to uncover seismic trends related to magnitude, depth, time, and location. Earthquake data is collected from the USGS Earthquake API, cleaned and transformed using Python, stored in a MySQL database, and visualized through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

The dashboard allows users to explore various earthquake patterns dynamically using SQL-based queries and interactive charts.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Collect real-world earthquake data from a reliable public API
- Clean and preprocess raw seismic data
- Store structured data in a relational database (MySQL)
- Perform SQL-based analytical queries
- Build an interactive dashboard using Streamlit
- Extract meaningful seismic insights for analysis
